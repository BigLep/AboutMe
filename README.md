# Why use GitHub vs. blog, website, LinkedIn, etc.
There's nothing mission critical here as to why, but the initial reasons are:
1. Provides easy access to an issue tracker for any improvements I want to do around this space.
2. If I bring code to this problem, I have a natural place to put it.
3. Fits with the desire not just to show the end product but also the process on how got there.

# Why are there lots of links to Google Docs?
For expediency, I author many of my documents in Google Docs because it provides:
1. provides quick formatting
2. good table of contents with navigation
3. solid mobile client for edit/view
4. multiple document types including Sheets
